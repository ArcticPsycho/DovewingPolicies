Dovewing Bot Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 7th, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Dovewing Bot Team ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information from users ("you") of the Dovewing Discord bot ("the Bot").

1. What Data We Collect
When you interact with the Bot and use features like creating cat profiles, we collect the following information:

Your Discord User ID: This is a unique numerical identifier provided by Discord. We need this to associate your cat profiles with your Discord account.
Cat Profile Data: This includes the information you explicitly provide when creating or editing a cat profile through Bot commands: the cat's name, clan, strength, intelligence, and spirit stats.

We do not persistently store your Discord username, display name, or any message content beyond what is immediately necessary to process the commands you send to the Bot. Your username/display name is retrieved
live from Discord when needed for display purposes (e.g., in embeds).

The Bot requests Administrator permissions during installation. While this grants broad technical capabilities, the Bot is only designed to access and use the specific data mentioned above for its intended features.

2. How We Use Your Data
The data we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

To provide the core features of the Bot, including generating randomized names based on source data and allowing you to create, view, list, edit, and delete your personal cat profiles.
To associate your cat profiles with your specific Discord account (via your User ID).
To respond to your commands and display your saved cat profiles to you.

We do not use your data for advertising, tracking, or any purpose other than providing the Bot's functionality.

3. How We Store Your Data
Your Discord User ID and cat profile data are stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted by Railway Inc. We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the data stored in the database. Access to the database is restricted to the Bot's owner through secure credentials managed via Railway. While we maintain account access, please be aware that, as with any hosting provider, Railway Inc. staff may have technical access to the underlying infrastructure and data for operational and support purposes, subject to their own privacy policies and terms.

4. Third Parties
We utilize Railway Inc. for hosting the Bot's database (PostgreSQL). Data is stored on infrastructure provided by them. Aside from this necessary hosting provider, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal data with any other third parties.
The Bot interacts with the Discord API to function. Your use of Discord itself is subject to Discord's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

5. Data Retention
We retain your cat profile data (User ID and associated cat information) indefinitely until you choose to delete a specific cat profile using the /deletecat command. Once a cat profile is deleted via this command, it is permanently removed from the database and cannot be recovered by the Bot or the owner.

6. Your Rights
You have the right to access, modify, and delete your data stored by the Bot. You can exercise these rights using the provided Bot commands:

/mycat [Name] or .mycat [Name] to view a specific cat's data.

/mycats or .mycats to list all your saved cat names.

/editcat [Name] [STR] [INT] [SPR] or .editcat [Name] [STR] [INT] [SPR] to modify a cat's stats.

/deletecat [Name] or .deletecat [Name] to permanently delete a cat profile.

If you have questions about the data stored or require assistance that cannot be resolved via Bot commands, you can contact us using the method provided in the "Contact Us" section below.

7. Security
We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data stored in the database. However, please be aware that no data transmission over the internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

8. Administrator Permissions
The Bot requests Administrator permissions upon joining a server. This broad permission level simplifies certain Discord features or potential future functionalities. However, as stated in Section 1, the Bot is designed and intended to only collect and store the specific data outlined in this policy for its stated features and does not actively access or utilize permissions to collect private data beyond what is necessary for its core functions and explicitly provided by you through commands.

9. Children's Privacy
The Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. By using the Bot, you confirm that you meet Discord's minimum age requirement. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that a user under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy [Suggest how you will notify users, e.g., on the Bot's support Discord server or by updating the date at the top of the policy]. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

11. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Bot's data practices, please contact us through the official Bot support Discord server: https://discord.gg/JQKUBXeH9f
