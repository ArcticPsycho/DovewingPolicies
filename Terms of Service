Dovewing Bot Terms of Service
Effective Date: July 7th, 2025

Welcome to Dovewing! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Dovewing Discord bot ("the Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Bot.

1. Acceptance of Terms
By adding the Bot to a server or interacting with it in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. These Terms apply to all users of the Bot.

2. Description of Service
The Bot provides utility features for Discord users, including randomized Warrior Cat name generation, dice rolling, and the ability to create, store, and manage personal cat profiles.

3. Acceptable Use Policy
You agree not to use the Bot to:

Violate any applicable laws or regulations.
Engage in any form of gambling or betting using the dice rolling commands or any other feature.
Spam or flood channels with Bot commands or output.
Harass, abuse, or harm other users.
Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bot's systems or data.
Use the Bot in any way that could disrupt, damage, or impair the Bot or Discord's services.
Use the Bot for any purpose other than its intended utility features as described.

4. User Content (Cat Profiles)
You retain ownership of the data you input when creating cat profiles (cat name, clan, stats). By providing this data, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, display, and process this data 
solely for the purpose of providing the Bot's features to you (e.g., allowing you to view, edit, and list your profiles). We do not claim ownership over your creative data, but we require this license to operate the profile feature.

5. Intellectual Property
The Bot's code, design, and any associated assets (excluding data explicitly provided by users or sourced from public domains like the CSV names) are 
the intellectual property of the Dovewing Bot Team and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Bot is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the Bot's reliability, availability, 
or fitness for a particular purpose. We do not guarantee that the Bot will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.

7. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Dovewing Bot Team shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
 or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting 
from (a) your use or inability to use the Bot; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal data stored therein.

8. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Bot at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability, 
including if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Bot will immediately cease. If you wish to 
terminate these Terms, you may simply cease using the Bot and remove it from any servers you manage.

9. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide notice via announcement at https://discord.gg/JQKUBXeH9f. By continuing to access
or use the Bot after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

10. Administrator Permissions
You acknowledge that adding the Bot may require granting it Administrator permissions on your Discord server. By adding the Bot and agreeing to these Terms, 
you accept that the Bot has these permissions. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, the Bot is designed to use these permissions only as necessary for its intended 
features and does not utilize them to access private data beyond what is required for core functionality and explicitly provided by you.

11. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
